## About Me
Welcome to my personal portfolio. I am an Electrical Engineering professional currently expanding my expertise by pursuing a Computer Science degree and developing advanced computing skill sets.
## Skills
- Electrical Technician
- Engineering Technician
- Computer Technician
- Computer Science Technician
## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? 
   Interpreting user needs begins with understanding the problem from the user’s perspective. The goal is to identify what the user is trying to accomplish.
- Step 1: Gather and Clarify Requirements
- Step 2: You must translate Needs into Functional Requirements which the developer can then convert into system behavior.
- Step 3: Technical break down into Relevant to do Tasks
- Step 4: Validate with Feedback
## How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   User stories help bridge the gap between user needs and technical implementation. They keep the focus on value that are needed instead of features which may not be needed.
## Why user stories help?
- They focus on value
- They encourage conversation
- They support prioritization
- They enable incremental development
- They connect directly to testing
## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   I approach developing programs using a structured but iterative mindset. Instead of trying to build the entire system at once, I focus on understanding the problem, breaking     it into manageable components, and trying to deliver working increments.
- First, I begin with problem clarification. 
- Second, I decompose the system into smaller parts. 
- Third, I try designing before creating any coding. 
- Fourth, I implement the system incrementally. 
- Fifth, I test continuously. 
- Finally, I reflect and refine. 
  This structured yet flexible approach promotes clarity, maintainability, and steady progress.
## What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   In future development work, I hope to incorporate several key Agile processes that enhance collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement.
- 1. User Stories with Clear Acceptance Criteria
- 2. Sprint Planning
- 3. Daily Stand-ups
- 4. Continuous Integration and Frequent Testing
- 5. Sprint Reviews
- 6. Sprint Retrospectives
- 7. Backlog Refinement
  # Overall Development Philosophy
    My goal is to combine technical discipline with Agile adaptability with the aim of:
- a. Focusing on delivering working software early and often
- b. Prioritizing customer value over rigid planning
- c. Maintaining open communication across roles
- d. Embracing change rather than resist it
- e. Continuously improving both product and process
  This mindset supports scalable, maintainable, and high-quality software development while aligning technical work with real user needs.
## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   Being a good team member in software development means contributing not only technical skills, but also collaboration, accountability, and a mindset focused on shared   
   success. Software development is rarely an individual effort, it is a coordinated process involving developers, testers, product owners, designers, and stakeholders.
- Strong Communication
- Accountability and Reliability
- Collaboration Over Competition
- Openness to Feedback
- Commitment to Quality
- Adaptability
- Respect and Professionalism
  # In an Agile Environment
    Within Scrum or Agile teams, being a good team member also means:
- a. Participating actively in Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Reviews, and Retrospectives
- b. Supporting continuous improvement
- c. Focusing on delivering working software each Sprint
- d. Helping remove impediments, not just identifying them
  # Overall Reflection
    A good team member in software development balances technical competence with the spirit of collaboration. Success is measured not only by the code written but by the value
    delivered, the trust built within the team, and the ability to grow collectively.
